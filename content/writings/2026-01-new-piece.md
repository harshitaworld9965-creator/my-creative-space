I could write a whole essay on how intellectualize your own pain and suffering, but it would just make me look not stupid which in turn feeds my ego of being above intelligent. And if I am not intelligent, then does my pain even matter? If I was average, that would add to the suffering even more, being common or even the label common would just erase everything I have been through.
